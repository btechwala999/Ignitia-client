Ignitia is an advanced web application that leverages Groq's powerful AI to generate and solve academic questions for teachers, researchers, and students. The platform helps in creating, managing, and solving question papers across various subjects and difficulty levels.

## Features

### For Teachers & Educators
- **AI-powered Question Generation**: Generate high-quality questions instantly from topics or syllabus content
- **Customizable Question Types**: Create multiple question types: MCQ, Short Answer, Long Answer, Diagrams, Code-based
- **Advanced Configuration**: Set difficulty levels, Bloom's taxonomy targets, and more
- **Export Capabilities**: Export question papers in PDF format with or without answers
- **Syllabus Mapper**: Use syllabus content to generate highly relevant questions
- **Question Bank**: Save and organize questions for future use
- **Solve Questions**: AI-powered question paper solver with step-by-step answers

## AI-Powered Question Generation

The core feature of EduIQ is its AI-powered question generation system. It uses the Groq API with LLaMA 3 70B model to create high-quality educational questions based on:

- **Topic**: Generate questions on specific subject areas
- **Difficulty Level**: Easy, Medium, or Hard questions
- **Question Types**: MCQ, Short Answer, Long Answer, Diagram-based, or Code-based
- **Bloom's Taxonomy Level**: Target specific cognitive levels (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
- **Syllabus Input**: Use curriculum content to generate highly relevant questions

Each generated question includes:
- Question text
- Options (for MCQs)
- Correct answers
- Explanations
- Marks allocation based on difficulty
- Taxonomy classification

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB
- Groq API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ignitia.git
cd eduiq
```

2. Install dependencies for backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

3. Install dependencies for frontend
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables
- Create a `.env` file in the server directory with:
```
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://utkarshsinghus238:U6a91vR5T6kb7Iqm@question-paper-maker.ql2jcrx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=question-paper-maker
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

5. Start the development servers
```bash
# In the server directory
npm run dev

# In the client directory
npm run dev
```

## Implementation Details

### AI Question Generation Flow
1. User selects topic, difficulty, question type, and other parameters
2. Frontend sends request to `/api/v1/question-papers/generate` endpoint
3. Backend constructs an optimized prompt for the Groq API
4. Groq API generates questions and returns structured JSON
5. Questions are displayed to user for review
6. User can save the generated questions as a question paper

### Question Paper Management
1. Question papers are stored in MongoDB with references to creators
2. PDF export is handled by Puppeteer for high-quality documents
3. Role-based permissions ensure only authorized users can manage papers
